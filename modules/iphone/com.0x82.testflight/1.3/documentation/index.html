<h2>Accessing the testflight Module</h2>

<p>To access this module from JavaScript, you would do the following:</p>

<pre><code>var testflight = require("com.0x82.testflight");
</code></pre>

<p>The testflight variable is a reference to the Module object.</p>

<h2>Reference</h2>

<h3>testflight.takeOff(teamToken)</h3>

<p>This should be the first function you should call to initialize the module. It
starts a TestFlight session, setups the crash handler, and sends pending notifications
to the server.</p>

<p>It accepts a single argument <em>teamToken</em>, with your TestFlight team token. You can obtain
that token at https://testflightapp.com/dashboard/team/edit</p>

<h3>testflight.passCheckpoint(checkPointName)</h3>

<p>Track when a user has passed a checkppint after the flight has taken off. Eg. passed
level 1, posted hight score, etc.</p>

<p>It accepts a single argument <em>checkPointName</em> with the String name of the checkpoint.</p>

<h3>testflight.openFeedbackView()</h3>

<p>Opens a feedback window that is not attached to a checkpoint. You should just call it
with no arguments. The windows open modally.</p>

<h3>testflight.addCustomEnvironmentInformation(hashOptions)</h3>

<p>Add custom environment information. If you want to track a user name from your application you
can add it here.</p>

<p>It accepts a single hash/dictionary argument <em>hashOptions</em>, with key/value pairs of options
you want to set on your environment.</p>

<h3>testflight.submitFeedback(text)</h3>

<p>Sends a custom feedback to the server without showing the feedback view. Accepts a single parameter
which should be a String with the text to send to the testflight server.</p>

<h3>testflight.setDeviceIdentifier(string)</h3>

<p>The module no longer obtains the device unique identifier. This method should only
be used during testing so that you can identify a testers test data with them.
If you do not provide the identifier you will still see all session data, with
checkpoints and logs, but the data will be anonymized.  It is recommended that
you only use this method during testing. </p>

<p><em>TL;DR:</em> Using this method on production could make you app fail the approval process!</p>
